This repository is of my innovaxel assigment.

Assignment:
You must create a simple RESTful API that allows users to shorten long URLs. The API should
provide endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete short URLs. It should also provide
statistics on the number of times a short URL has been accessed.


Notes:
I will use NodeJS for backend and MongoDB(local) as database.

I will follow MVC pattern to write clean, maintainable and scalable code.

Modals: Main class(Url)
Controller: Url Controller
Services: services folder will contain code like db connection etc.
